USAGE

  as the second argument of the command, put the relative path to the template html document.
  as the third argument of the command, put the relative path to the casting json document.

  if one of these two paths is invalid or undefined, you will receive this message again.

  since statichog uses standard out for its output, you can pipe that data into another command, or a file (as shown below).

EXAMPLE

  statichog replace template.html cast.json > output.html
